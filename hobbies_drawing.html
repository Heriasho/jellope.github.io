                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>One of my ultimate pasttimes is drawing. Helps me express some creativity when all I got are the basics. MSPaint is my prefered software for simplicity, but I have used GIMP and Photoshop to make other stuff.</p>
                        <p>While seeking to design my own campaign in college I went to great depths to outline maps for all my areas. For this one I went with a great forest with swamps, sandy patches, and major preservation of wildlife even though several civilized cultures live here.</p>
                        <img style="width:70%"  src="hobbies/mspaint/Bolltree2.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>This map outlines a coastal city I wanted to be a focal point of the campaign, designed with the idea that this culture does not specialize in navial ventures and has had to make compromises with the land to build the city.</p>
                        <img style="width:70%"  src="hobbies/mspaint/Riverside.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>For a friend's campaign I designed the town he had difficulty describing to us in words, highlighting several main homes in a series of forked road paths, surrounded by a big wooden fence and supportive of several vegitable farms.</p>
                        <p>If you want an idea of how much I was working with initially, he called this state <b>Country A</b> with this being town <b>Teseria</b> after a woman who lives here.</p>
                        <img style="width:70%"  src="hobbies/mspaint/village.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>Inspiration for this drawing came from playing <b>Mechanicius</b> where my dungeon delving tech priests delved into mysterious ancient tombs with larger-than-life ambience.</p>
                        <p>This is the Hal'ral tomb, an ancient order of magic wielding Dwarven knights in my D&D setting who were entombed in their mountain crypt along side their magical secrets. An evil cult is at work to uncover these secrets and the heroes are here to thwart their plans.</p>
                        <img style="width:70%"  src="hobbies/mspaint/halralTomb.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>When I setup a region for my player's first session I did not anticipate additional players wished to join, especially with totally different backgrounds. To accommodate and further flesh out my world, I drew out a swamp that a traveling gnome druid player could be in along side his wood elf monk companion. </p>
                        <img style="width:70%"  src="hobbies/mspaint/serpentMorass.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>In my secret historian lab I hypothesised what would happen if in 55ad the Romans never invaded Gaul (Iron Age areas of modern day France) and the various supersitious beliefs of the Celts were real in this fantasy setting simply called "Gual".</p>
                        <p>This setting emphasizes the idea that the ideals of the individual and the connection they have to their home were what made them strong in a meta-physical sense, amped up in a world where drudic rituals actually can change the weather or bring famin upon your house's enemies.</p>
                        <p>I got as far as to design the cultures and sub cultures of the various indigenious Gaulic tribes, each themed around an element of nature, often represented by the flags they wear and the land they inhabit.</p>
                        <img style="width:70%"  src="hobbies/mspaint/55c.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>Long ago in a legends book reading far away, I got the idea for an Old Republic Star Wars Roleplay setting and drew a map for it.</p>
                        <p>Typically in Star Wars legends lore, the timeline is listed based off BBY, before Battle at Yavin, using the destruction of the first Death Star as a chronological focal point.</p>
                        <p>The map is based on various old republic maps set around 4,000 BBY and planets listed in the Darth Bane series around 1,000 BBY.</p>
                        <p>As a result so I split the difference, including mentioned planets in both periods as potiential places for adventure.</p>
