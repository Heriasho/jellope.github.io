                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>History is my favorite subject of study. I nearly accidentially got a History minor in college due to how much history courses I've taken out of pure interest.</p>
                        <p>Often the way I like to passively relax is to watch history documentaries on youtube. If left to my own devices, I could probably watch these all day.</p>
                        <p>Because its a passion of mine, I got some channels I can recommend.</p>
                        <p><b>History Civilis</b> has perhaps the best playlist of Pre-Empire Roman History I've seen accumulated in one place on the internet.</p>

                        <p><b>History Civilis'</b> battle videos have a simple animation but to me is extremely effective at conveying the tatics and pitfalls of many battles throughout history. I enjoyed them enough to give them their own place here too.</p>

                        <p><b>Kings and Generals</b> creates amazing animated historial documentries discussing ancient warfare of early to late antiquity.</p>
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLaBYW76inbX6d5Q2IGrnaCAG9kTyqrLbP" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <p>I think it goes without saying that <b>History Buffs</b> are a favorite. Nick Hoagies reviewes historically themed movies to compare them to the history they are based on. His most influential reviews to me were on the movie Waterloo and Gladator, which swayed me to go watch them.</p>

                        <p>A special mention goes to the Tv Documentary Series <b>The Revolution</b> which thoroughly covers the American Revolution, with a huge chuck of details left out of typical American history classes. Watched in one sitting and was thoroughly entertained.</p>

                        <p>An additional special mention goes to the History Documentary <b>Secrets of The Aegean Apocalypse</b> that discuss a popular theory on what cataclysm caused the end of the Brozen Age.</p>
                        <p>Even if the suggested theory is proven incorrect, I'm deeply fascinated with how so many powerful empires fell apart in such a short period of time. Probably was aliens.</p>
