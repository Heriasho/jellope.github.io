                    <div class="card-body">
                      <p>My world encompasses a mixing pot of fantasy races thrown together by a mythos of ancient conflicts and colamities started by started by races that still exist in a declining state. </p>
                      <h3>Ancient Penra</h3>
                      <p>The ancient status quo pertained between Dragon and Giant-kind, the prime races of Penra, who ruled over the 'lesser races' and ran their own mighty empires.</p>
                      <p>A major event in Penra's history was the total collapse of the realm Evergreen, home of the Fey, split by its ruling Elven Empire Magical Civil War that resulted in magical tares between the Marial Realm and the Evergreen. </p>
                      <p>Being the world where the naturalistic energies of universe come from, these tares had rapturous consequences on the Material Realm, taring some continents asunder, enhancing the ferociousness of its inhabitance's biology, and corrupting the natural cycle of nature. </p>
                      <p>For this misdeed, the Fey banished Elven-kind from the Evergreen, made worst off when brought under the dominion of the Dragonic Empire.</p>
                      <p>In the years without wars to rage, the Dragons experimented with their slaves and produced half breeds to serve in their armies.</p>
                      <p>But no period of time is ever truely peaceful. Amiss this tranqual time, man and dwarf warred as proxies for Giant-kind against the Elves and Dragonborn of the Dragons. </p>
                      <p>How the great conflict eventually arose remains a mystery, though the powerkeg to such a war was inevitable to spark. </p>
                      <p>Eventually these mighty empires were brought low in their war, and were brought to near exinction when their unified slaves rose up, fortified by astral powers of foreign gods.</p> 
                      <p>Devistated, the giants lost their kingdom and the many dragon flights were forced into hiding.</p>
                      <p>Since then, the state of Penra's fate has been left in the hands of morals.</p>

                      <h3>Region of Sardon</h3>
                        <p>The major powers here are the wealthy noblemen Julius Capinaro of Sardon and Antonius Walden of Bouldercrest. 
                            Julius' father, Flotinius Capinaro had inherited the prosperous town from his father but sought greater power and dominion over the land. 
                            Against the advice of his chief architects and men at arm's he built a castle within the swamp known as the Serpent Morass. 
                            The construction crew became attacked by lizard men from the marsh. For months this went on till Flotinus was forced to abandon the project mid construction, leaving the castle to the elements. 
                            This curtailed human expansion southward for many decades. </p>
                        <p>Five years prior to our game, brave nobles funded expeditions to sail past the swamp and settle land southward.
                            The first colony became known as Boralius, and the rest of the story continues from there. </p>                            
                        <p> The Capinaro family rules over Sardon and benifit from a lifestyle of mercantile lords as the city is a coastal trade hub of the region.
                            The Walden family run an expedition colony consisting of Boralus and it's Fort, Mendel's, Rateduza, and Bouldercrest Keep.</p>

                      <h3>Region of Bouldercrest</h3>
                        <p>For my local friends we are playing in the Bouldercrest region, a group of frontier settlements east of Sardon under the authority of the Walden family.</p>
                        <p>Adventurers are called to the location to deal with local problems ranging from road bandits, cults to dark gods, and even a marching hobgoblin legion.</p>

                        <p>Here are our heroes (from the center to the right) Kreyg, the Half-Elf Lore Bard, and Kriv, the Dragonborn Paladin.</p>
                        <p>They are accompanied by Hans, the Cleric of Pelor, and Arthur Ward, the Captain of the Rateduza town guard.</p>

                        <p>Amist starting a in-person game, I decided to take up miniature collecting and painting for fun.</p>
                        <p>Here is my little militia for the town of Rateduza.</p>
