                      <p><b>Ghost Mushroom</b> Since purple dye and a crystal vial can be purchased from common vendors, the only farmable regent is the ghost mushrooms. These are located in the Hinterlands and Descolace as well as dropped from Mauradon bosses at an average of (11.2%).</p>
                      <p><b>Secret:</b> There is Fungal Rock in Un'Goro Crater that may prove to be the best farming spot for a herbalist.</p>
