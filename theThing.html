						<p>In the Age of Conquest, Grand Hegemon of Teshiora, Horus Khan, sets out to expand his empire across the globe. With an
						infamous lineage of conquering emperors and empresses, the Empire's territory extends over the lands of many cultures
						and races, forcefully converted into a homogeneous people simply known as The Empire of Teshiora.</p>
						<p>Lately the Grand Hegemon has had his sights on the distant lands beyond the Sea of Three Snakes named Geroca. His
						scouting parties have encountered wild tribes folk, hostile foreign specters, beastmen, and various other dangerous foes
						that need cleansing in order the land to yield to the Empire.</p>

					<p>BEASTMEN Rumors: There have been sightings of large beasts in the lands south of Dominica that apparently are conjoined part man part beast.
						They have been reported to travel in herds of their kind and wield large axehead or spear weapons akin to our own. Most disturbing, these beasts seem to have magical dominion over their environment to an unknown extent. Traveler beware!</p>
					<p>BEASTS: Large beasts are a normal occurance in lands as lush and green as Geroca, however there are some beasts travelers should be aware of. </p>
					<p>Gigorza: What is coming to be known as the Gigorza in the School of Beast Studies, this quadrupe creature towers 3 men
					stacked together and can leverage the strength of 2 Dwarve smiths with a long facial trunk. Gigorza are docial when left
					alone but, when approach, will defend itself and its offspring with a fury that is believed to be unstoppable with
					conviential weapons. These creatures should be left alone.</p>
