                        <p>My favorite game. The one I've played for over a decade and has definied my childhood.</p>
                        <p>It was my major intro into PC gaming, pushing me towards a focus on computer and later an interest into designing games.</p>
                        <p>One aspect of Wow I really enjoy is its captavating score with its soundtrack. I always feel nostalgic about my early years when I listen to it.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/wow/Bazadar.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>This is my 2nd main character I've ever made, right after the first one on my previous account (a night elf Druid named Bornhan) got banned during Wraith of the Lich King when a ton of accounts were getting compromised by hackers.</p>
                        <p>I would play this guy into the modern day with the occational race change or two and always tried to specialize as a Fire Mage, because thematically I always thought that was pretty cool.</p>
                        <p>This particular set of gear from Cataclysm is what I believed to be the most flavorful and faithful to the roleplay of a fire mage.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/wow/Marcco.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>Around the time I was in my first relationship I made this character to mimic a text roleplay character they played.</p>
                        <p>I worked towards leveling this character through pvp, since that was their focus in the roleplay, and got them tier gear and several tabards for pvp related activities.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/wow/Kanorine.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>Kanorine is an ancient character, dating back to Buring Crusade, who partiually made up my username for several old websites when I first got started with wow.</p>
                        <p>Though never a main character, I always make sure to level her to the expansion's max before the next one started.</p>
                        <p><b>Post-Warlords of Draenor</b></p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/wow/Zargulg.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>Good o'Zargulg. Race and name changed over the years for this warlock but his roleplay persona never changed. He is callus, vindictive, and a tad sadistic.</p>
                        <p>I manged to complete the Green Fire Quest for him during Mists of Pandara and earned the ability to cast green fire spells as Destruction spec.</p>
                        <p>Like Kanorine, I faithfully leveled him each expansion.</p>

                        <p><b>Game: Hat in Time</b></p>
                        <p><b>Genre: Platformer</b></p>
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JoJYOEm9RMY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <p>The game that appropriately honors the being known as the hat loli.</p>
                        <p>Its a platformer that takes inspiration from old school platformers like Banjo Kazooie and Super Mario 64 and modernizes the platformer formula without taking up many of their issues.</p>
                        <p>Like usual, I am strongly attached to the game's music set as well, even going so far as to buy it seperately because of how good it is.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/hit/hit2.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>One really cool feature of the game is the ability to collect an ingame powerup that lets you freeze the game frame and move the camera freely to take screenshots. I made good use of this.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/hit/murder.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>I dont intense to spoil the game's plot. The main focus outside of the platforming is the game's humor which is holy unique to it.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/hit/howToKillKids.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>With the latest patch you can play with up to 50 friends along side your hat loli, which just makes the experience that much more memorable.</p>

                        <p><b>Game: Astroneer</b></p>
                        <p><b>Genre: Adventure builder</b></p>
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a589_PcTVVE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <p>The game I go to decompress. Its an adventure game with lite survival elements and a focus on exploring.</p>
                        <p>Though it is an indie title you can't help but feel that alot of time was put into building a visually stunning world, even if it is randomly generated.</p>
                        <p>The music is so soothing to the play experience that it lets you mellow out. It is very easy to lose track of time playing this game.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/astroneer/astro_1.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>A main feature of the game is the digging and base building, with the tech tree and design all being modular and relatively simple to follow.</p>
                        <p>A favorite feature of mine is when you can attach modules to other modules to uniquely organize your base and to allow new abilities for your dig cannon.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/astroneer/astro_3.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>You can also play with friends and explore other planets in the system, which again adds to the replay value of the game.</p>

                        <p>Did I mention this game is pretty to look at?</p>

                        <p>I enjoy metal music or just load music in general. I especially like it when it can be tied to a story, like how a modern bard would tell it.</p>
                        <p>Sabaton does military and wartime music pieces, in this case the first world war, while Brothers of Metal cover mythological stories from norse mythology, both in a power metal format that is just awesome to jam to.</p>
                        <p>This kind of music gets me pumped to tackle a hard task or endure a period of gruleing work.</p>

                            <p>One of my ultimate pasttimes is drawing. Helps me express creativity when all I got are the basics. MSPaint is my prefered software for simplicity, but I have used GIMP and Photoshop to make other stuff.</p>
                            <img class="card-img-top" src="hobbies/mspaint/Bbb.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                            <p>This is a pathfinder human druid I drew for a campaign with the goal of making him look like an everyday herbalist. He takes inspiration from a World of Warcraft starter cloth set for humans.</p>

                            <p>This is Huckybiscuit, one of my World of Warcraft main characters, speced as a fury warrior wielding two large swords. I screencapped him in game and drew with the picture as reference.</p>
                            <img class="card-img-top" src="hobbies/mspaint/DrunkRyan.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                            <p>On the flipside, this is Bornhan (a reincarnation of my first character as a paladin) holding a pint. In similar format to Huckybiscuit I screencapped him in game and drew with the picture as refernce.</p>

                            <p>While seeking to design my own campaign in college I went to great depths to outline maps for all my areas. For this one I went with a great forest with swamps, sandy patches, and major preservation of wildlife even though several civilized cultures live here.</p>
                            <img class="card-img-top" src="hobbies/mspaint/Riverside.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                            <p>This map outlines a coastal city I wanted to be a focal point of the campaign, designed with the idea that this culture does not specialize in navial ventures and has had to make compromises with the land to build the city.</p>

                            <p>For a friend's campaign I designed the town he had difficulty describing to us in words, highlighting several main homes in a series of forked road paths, surrounded by a big wooden fence and supportive of several vegitable farms.</p>
                            <p>If you want an idea of how much I was working with initially, he called this state <b>Country A</b> with this being town <b>Teseria</b> after a woman who lives here.</p>

                        <p>This is a pathfinder human druid I drew for a campaign with the goal of making him look like an everyday herbalist. He takes inspiration from a World of Warcraft starter cloth set for humans.</p>

                        <p>This is Huckybiscuit, one of my World of Warcraft main characters, speced as a fury warrior wielding two large swords. I screencapped him in game and drew with the picture as reference.</p>

                        <p>On the flipside, this is Bornhan (a reincarnation of my first character as a paladin) holding a pint. In similar format to Huckybiscuit I screencapped him in game and drew with the picture as refernce.</p>

                        <p>While seeking to design my own campaign in college I went to great depths to outline maps for all my areas. For this one I went with a great forest with swamps, sandy patches, and major preservation of wildlife even though several civilized cultures live here.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" src="hobbies/mspaint/Riverside.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>This map outlines a coastal city I wanted to be a focal point of the campaign, designed with the idea that this culture does not specialize in navial ventures and has had to make compromises with the land to build the city.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" src="hobbies/mspaint/village.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>For a friend's campaign I designed the town he had difficulty describing to us in words, highlighting several main homes in a series of forked road paths, surrounded by a big wooden fence and supportive of several vegitable farms.</p>
                        <p>If you want an idea of how much I was working with initially, he called this state <b>Country A</b> with this being town <b>Teseria</b> after a woman who lives here.</p>
