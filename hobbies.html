                      <div class="card-body">
                          <p>One of my ultimate pasttimes is drawing. Helps me express creativity when all I got are the basics. MSPaint is my prefered software for simplicity, but I have used GIMP and Photoshop to make other stuff.</p>
                          <!---<img style="width:70%" src="hobbies/mspaint/Bbb.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                          <p>This is a pathfinder human druid I drew for a campaign with the goal of making him look like an everyday herbalist. He takes inspiration from a World of Warcraft starter cloth set for humans.</p>
                          <img style="width:70%"  src="hobbies/mspaint/AggressiveRyan.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                          <p>This is Huckybiscuit, one of my World of Warcraft main characters, speced as a fury warrior wielding two large swords. I screencapped him in game and drew with the picture as reference.</p>
                          <img style="width:70%"  src="hobbies/mspaint/DrunkRyan.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                          <p>On the flipside, this is Bornhan (a reincarnation of my first character as a paladin) holding a pint. In similar format to Huckybiscuit I screencapped him in game and drew with the picture as refernce.</p>-->
                          <p>While seeking to design my own campaign in college I went to great depths to outline maps for all my areas. For this one I went with a great forest with swamps, sandy patches, and major preservation of wildlife even though several civilized cultures live here.</p>
                          <img style="width:70%"  src="hobbies/mspaint/Bolltree2.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                          <p>This map outlines a coastal city I wanted to be a focal point of the campaign, designed with the idea that this culture does not specialize in navial ventures and has had to make compromises with the land to build the city.</p>
                          <img style="width:70%"  src="hobbies/mspaint/Riverside.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                          <p>For a friend's campaign I designed the town he had difficulty describing to us in words, highlighting several main homes in a series of forked road paths, surrounded by a big wooden fence and supportive of several vegitable farms.</p>
                          <p>If you want an idea of how much I was working with initially, he called this state <b>Country A</b> with this being town <b>Teseria</b> after a woman who lives here.</p>
                          <img style="width:70%"  src="hobbies/mspaint/village.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                          <p>Inspiration for this drawing came from playing <b>Mechanicius</b> where my dungeon delving tech priests delved into mysterious ancient tombs with larger-than-life ambience.</p>
                          <p>This is the Hal'ral tomb, an ancient order of magic wielding Dwarven knights in my D&D setting who were entombed in their mountain crypt along side their magical secrets. An evil cult is at work to uncover these secrets and the heroes are here to thwart their plans.</p>
                          <img style="width:70%"  src="hobbies/mspaint/halralTomb.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                          <p>When I setup a region for my player's first session I did not anticipate additional players wished to join, especially with totally different backgrounds. To accommodate and further flesh out my world, I drew out a swamp that a traveling gnome druid player could be in along side his wood elf monk companion. </p>
                          <img style="width:70%"  src="hobbies/mspaint/serpentMorass.png" alt="Random Name"/>
                          <p>In my secret historian lab I hypothesised what would happen if in 55ad the Romans never invaded Gaul (Iron Age areas of modern day France) and the various supersitious beliefs of the Celts were real in this fantasy setting simply called "Gual".</p>
                          <p>This setting emphasizes the idea that the ideals of the individual and the connection they have to their home were what made them strong in a meta-physical sense, amped up in a world where drudic rituals actually can change the weather or bring famin upon your house's enemies.</p>
                          <p>I got as far as to design the cultures and sub cultures of the various indigenious Gaulic tribes, each themed around an element of nature, often represented by the flags they wear and the land they inhabit.</p>

                      <div class="card-body">
                          <p>History is my favorite subject of study. I nearly accidentially got a History minor in college due to how much history courses I've taken out of pure interest.</p>
                          <p>Often the way I like to passively relax is to watch history documentaries on youtube. If left to my own devices, I could probably watch these all day.</p>
                          <p>Because its a passion of mine, I got some channels I can recommend.</p>
                          <p><b>History Civilis</b> has perhaps the best playlist of Pre-Empire Roman History I've seen accumulated in one place on the internet.</p>
                          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLODnBH8kenOrjXjWy7Hhkz9uOpZ3NTAow" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                          <p><b>History Civilis'</b> battle videos have a simple animation but to me is extremely effective at conveying the tatics and pitfalls of many battles throughout history. I enjoyed them enough to give them their own place here too.</p>
                          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLODnBH8kenOpfxIxyWrrcaqox-PuCGqfl" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                          <p><b>Kings and Generals</b> creates amazing animated historial documentries discussing ancient warfare of early to late antiquity.</p>
                          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLaBYW76inbX6d5Q2IGrnaCAG9kTyqrLbP" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                          <p>I think it goes without saying that <b>History Buffs</b> are a favorite. Nick Hoagies reviewes historically themed movies to compare them to the history they are based on. His most influential reviews to me were on the movie Waterloo and Gladator, which swayed me to go watch them.</p>
                          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL6v84_2tuJD6QvZxHSW96SsM_QgaA7nR3" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                          <p>A special mention goes to the Tv Documentary Series <b>The Revolution</b> which thoroughly covers the American Revolution, with a huge chuck of details left out of typical American history classes. Watched in one sitting and was thoroughly entertained.</p>
                          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/51hKUCY1VY8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                          <p>An additional special mention goes to the History Documentary <b>Secrets of The Aegean Apocalypse</b> that discuss a popular theory on what cataclysm caused the end of the Brozen Age.</p>
                          <p>Even if the suggested theory is proven incorrect, I'm deeply fascinated with how so many powerful empires fell apart in such a short period of time. Probably was aliens.</p>

                    <p>My world encompasses a mixing pot of fantasy races thrown together by a mythos of ancient conflicts and colamities started by started by races that still exist in a declining state. </p>
                    <h3>Ancient Penra</h3>
                    <p>The ancient status quo pertained between Dragon and Giant-kind, the prime races of Penra, who ruled over the 'lesser races' and ran their own mighty empires.</p>
                    <p>A major event in Penra's history was the total collapse of the realm Evergreen, home of the Fey, split by its ruling Elven Empire Magical Civil War that resulted in magical tares between the Marial Realm and the Evergreen. </p>
                    <p>Being the world where the naturalistic energies of universe come from, these tares had rapturous consequences on the Material Realm, taring some continents asunder, enhancing the ferociousness of its inhabitance's biology, and corrupting the natural cycle of nature. </p>
                    <p>For this misdeed, the Fey banished Elven-kind from the Evergreen, made worst off when brought under the dominion of the Dragonic Empire.</p>
                    <p>In the years without wars to rage, the Dragons experimented with their slaves and produced half breeds to serve in their armies.</p>
                    <p>But no period of time is ever truely peaceful. Amiss this tranqual time, man and dwarf warred as proxies for Giant-kind against the Elves and Dragonborn of the Dragons. </p>
                    <p>How the great conflict eventually arose remains a mystery, though the powerkeg to such a war was inevitable to spark. </p>
                    <p>Eventually these mighty empires were brought low in their war, and were brought to near exinction when their unified slaves rose up, fortified by astral powers of foreign gods.</p> 
                    <p>Devistated, the giants lost their kingdom and the many dragon flights were forced into hiding.</p>
                    <p>Since then, the state of Penra's fate has been left in the hands of morals.</p>

                        <p>It was my major intro into PC gaming, pushing me towards a focus on computer and later an interest into designing games.</p>
                        <p>One aspect of Wow I really enjoy is its captavating score with its soundtrack. I always feel nostalgic about my early years when I listen to it.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/wow/Bazadar.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>This is my 2nd main character I've ever made, right after the first one on my previous account (a night elf Druid named Bornhan) got banned during Wraith of the Lich King when a ton of accounts were getting compromised by hackers.</p>
                        <p>I would play this guy into the modern day with the occational race change or two and always tried to specialize as a Fire Mage, because thematically I always thought that was pretty cool.</p>
                        <p>This particular set of gear from Cataclysm is what I believed to be the most flavorful and faithful to the roleplay of a fire mage.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/wow/Marcco.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>Around the time I was in my first relationship I made this character to mimic a text roleplay character they played.</p>
                        <p>I worked towards leveling this character through pvp, since that was their focus in the roleplay, and got them tier gear and several tabards for pvp related activities.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/wow/Kanorine.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>Kanorine is an ancient character, dating back to Buring Crusade, who partiually made up my username for several old websites when I first got started with wow.</p>
                        <p>Though never a main character, I always make sure to level her to the expansion's max before the next one started.</p>
                        <p><b>Post-Warlords of Draenor</b></p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/wow/Zargulg.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>Good o'Zargulg. Race and name changed over the years for this warlock but his roleplay persona never changed. He is callus, vindictive, and a tad sadistic.</p>
                        <p>I manged to complete the Green Fire Quest for him during Mists of Pandara and earned the ability to cast green fire spells as Destruction spec.</p>
                        <p>Like Kanorine, I faithfully leveled him each expansion.</p>

                        <p><b>Game: Hat in Time</b></p>
                        <p><b>Genre: Platformer</b></p>

                        <p>The game that appropriately honors the being known as the hat loli.</p>
                        <p>Its a platformer that takes inspiration from old school platformers like Banjo Kazooie and Super Mario 64 and modernizes the platformer formula without taking up many of their issues.</p>
                        <p>Like usual, I am strongly attached to the game's music set as well, even going so far as to buy it seperately because of how good it is.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/hit/hit2.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>One really cool feature of the game is the ability to collect an ingame powerup that lets you freeze the game frame and move the camera freely to take screenshots. I made good use of this.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/hit/murder.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>I dont intense to spoil the game's plot. The main focus outside of the platforming is the game's humor which is holy unique to it.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/hit/howToKillKids.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>With the latest patch you can play with up to 50 friends along side your hat loli, which just makes the experience that much more memorable.</p>

                        <p><b>Game: Astroneer</b></p>

                        <p>The game I go to decompress. Its an adventure game with lite survival elements and a focus on exploring.</p>
                        <p>Though it is an indie title you can't help but feel that alot of time was put into building a visually stunning world, even if it is randomly generated.</p>
                        <p>The music is so soothing to the play experience that it lets you mellow out. It is very easy to lose track of time playing this game.</p>
                        <img class="card-img-top" height="300" width="300"src="hobbies/astroneer/astro_1.jpg" alt="Random Name"/>
                        <p>A main feature of the game is the digging and base building, with the tech tree and design all being modular and relatively simple to follow.</p>
                        <p>A favorite feature of mine is when you can attach modules to other modules to uniquely organize your base and to allow new abilities for your dig cannon.</p>

                        <p>You can also play with friends and explore other planets in the system, which again adds to the replay value of the game.</p>

                        <p>Did I mention this game is pretty to look at?</p>

                        <p>I enjoy metal music or just load music in general. I especially like it when it can be tied to a story, like how a modern bard would tell it.</p>
                        <p>Sabaton does military and wartime music pieces, in this case the first world war, while Brothers of Metal cover mythological stories from norse mythology, both in a power metal format that is just awesome to jam to.</p>
                        <p>This kind of music gets me pumped to tackle a hard task or endure a period of gruleing work.</p>

                        <p>While seeking to design my own campaign in college I went to great depths to outline maps for all my areas. For this one I went with a great forest with swamps, sandy patches, and major preservation of wildlife even though several civilized cultures live here.</p>

                        <p>This map outlines a coastal city I wanted to be a focal point of the campaign, designed with the idea that this culture does not specialize in navial ventures and has had to make compromises with the land to build the city.</p>
